In 2018, I completed my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering from IIT Gandhinagar. Following my undergraduate studies, I pursued further education at the University of Florida, where I obtained a master's degree in Chemical Engineering in 2020. During my time at the University of Florida, I engaged in three internships. The first was at a petroleum/polymers company called SABIC, and the subsequent two were at a semiconductors company named Micron. Presently, I am employed as a Research & Development engineer at Micron's headquarters in Boise, Idaho. However, I am currently stationed at Micron's Singapore site for a temporary work assignment. 2)How did your time at IIT Gandhinagar shape your values, skills, and overall outlook on life and career? Ans)I consider myself lucky to have secured an AIR of 4500-5000, which led me to IIT Gandhinagar, instead of one of the older IITs. Looking back, my time at IIT GN was undeniably the most enriching and enjoyable four years of my life. The college went above and beyond to take care of its students, providing excellent facilities such as well-furnished rooms, liberal hostel rules, and financial aid. Moreover, the institution's approach to education introduced us to a vast world beyond mere rote learning and academics, broadening our perspectives. Throughout my journey at IITGN, I witnessed remarkable transformations in many of my batchmates, who matured and grew during their time at IITGN. One of the standout features of our college was its flexibility in terms of branch change, enabling students to explore different interests and excel in various electives. Even if your AIR rank was not great, the right choice of electives and self-learning could open doors to a core CS role for a chemical engineer. My journey at IITGN was made even more exciting by the opportunities to embark on three foreign internships in the US, Japan, and Singapore. These experiences played a crucial role in shaping my desire to pursue an MS abroad. The final two years of my college life proved to be the most valuable, as I honed my leadership skills while serving as the General Secretary, AIChE president, Class Representative and Shastrath Socratic Society secretary. IIT Gandhinagar provided me with an exceptional education and a platform to grow both academically and personally. I am truly grateful for the memories and experiences that have shaped my path ahead. 3)As the General Secretary and President of Alche, could you share some of your most memorable experiences and achievements during your leadership roles? Ans) Throughout our time on the student council, one of our achievements was initiating the first-ever inter-IIT student leadership conclave. We made it a priority to be approachable and student-friendly, and I take great pride in the fact that our student council was successful in achieving that. During my tenure as AICHE president, we took a step forward by creating the inaugural prototype of Chem-E-Car, which went on to compete in various inter-college events. It was an exciting and rewarding experience to witness our efforts come to life in such a tangible way. 4)Students often struggle with choosing the right career path. How did you approach this decision? Was it a process of trial and error, or did you always know you wanted to pursue a career in your field of study? Ans) To be honest, it was all about trial and error for me. In my opinion, the primary goal should be to seek exposure and gather knowledge about various career possibilities, whether it's entrepreneurship, core jobs, finance roles, or pursuing higher studies. At this stage of my career, I am still in the early phases, and I believe it's a journey that spans several decades, allowing room for trial and error. Having a clear career path right from the start is fantastic, but even if you don't, don't worry. The early years of your career offer ample opportunities to learn, explore, and adapt. Think of it as a marathon, not a do-or-die situation. Embrace the learning process, try different paths, and make adjustments along the way. It's all part of the journey towards building a fulfilling and successful career. 5)Achieving excellent TOEFL and GRE scores must have been quite an accomplishment. Could you share some tips and strategies for achieving high scores in these exams? Ans) I enrolled in Magoosh courses and dedicated time to practicing full-length tests multiple times. In fact, I recommend considering taking the GRE/TOEFL exams during your third year of study to get a head start in the application process. However, it's important to keep in mind that GRE/TOEFL scores are primarily for gaining admission to a specific college, and their significance diminishes afterward. In the grand scheme of things, a slight difference in scores, like 315 vs. 330, won't have a significant impact. Instead, I encourage you to focus on optimizing other critical aspects of your admission package, such as strong Letters of Recommendation (LORs), well-crafted Statements of Purpose (SOPs), notable projects, and impactful internships. These elements carry substantial weight in your application and can greatly enhance your chances of admission, beyond just relying on GRE scores. 6)How did you decide to pursue a Master's degree, and why did you choose the University of Florida for your further studies?What were the major differences between the culture at IITGN and UF? Ans) Both IITGN and UF are excellent places. They both offer flexibility in terms of elective courses, internships and provide ample opportunities for engaging in extracurricular activities. In my case, I decided to attend UF primarily because I was awarded a significant scholarship, which made it a financially convenient option. During your final year, there might be a tendency among students to feel pressured to secure admission to top Ivy League colleges. However, in my personal opinion, particularly concerning pursuing a Master's degree (I cannot comment on PhDs), the disparity between attending a US rank #10 college versus a US rank #90 college won't significantly impact your long-term career prospects. Hence, I opted for UF, which is a reputable college, and the scholarship simplified the financial part, making it a more practical choice for me. 7)What opportunities did your Master's degree open up for you professionally? How did it contribute to your career growth and aspirations? Ans) During my Master's program, I was exposed to the world of semiconductors. This industry is highly specialized, and only a few developed countries possess the expertise and resources required to manufacture advanced chips. Hopefully, India will be a semiconductor powerhouse in the near future. At UF, I had access to a cleanroom facility where I had the opportunity to work on lab courses and fabricate semiconductor devices. My experience at UF played a pivotal role in opening doors for me within the semiconductor industry and our IIT alumni helped me land my foot in the door. Presently, I am actively engaged in this field and enjoying my work in this exciting and cutting-edge domain. 8)Based on your experiences and successes, what advice would you give to current students and upcoming graduates as they navigate their academic and professional journeys? Ans) Embrace your time at IITGN and seize every opportunity to enhance your soft skills. Learn the art of networking and engaging in conversations with people from diverse countries and cultures. Take inspiration from skilled individuals like Atul Singh to refine your writing abilities and excel in communication. Seek out experiences that offer valuable exposure, such as international internships, involvement in startups, engaging in research projects, and exploring a wide range of extracurricular activities.

        description: "Kindly provide a comprehensive explanation of the research problems currently being addressed by you and your research group. Additionally, please elucidate how your group's research will impact individuals day-to-day lives in the future from a layman's perspective. Furthermore, could you share examples of successful real-world applications where the machine learning algorithms you have developed or researched have been implemented, leveraging your expertise in Machine Learning? Our group called the sustainability group, works on applications pertaining to energy, air quality and health. We mostly work on machine learning problems with uncertainty. Here is a flavour of the kind of work we do. Air quality: A significant proportion of the Indian (and global) population is exposed to severe air pollution leading to several diseases and loss of life. We can not reduce what we can not accurately measure. However, the number of air quality measurement stations is significantly lower than the required numbers. Our work develops Bayesian machine learning methods to accurately estimate air quality at locations without any sensors. Importantly, we focus on not only providing the predicted air quality at a location but also uncertainty estimates. We then leverage this uncertainty to recommend where to install the next set of stations (also called active learning) to improve the predictive performance of our models. Health: The Apple Watch and similar wearables such as portable diabetes machines and oxygen saturation monitors have revolutionised healthcare. We look at creating similar wearables for estimating lung function and calorie count. We developed a mask-based system called SpiroMask that can accurately estimate various lung health parameters using an inexpensive system sitting at home, which earlier required a visit to a clinic. Similarly, we are presently developing a thermal camera-based system to accurately estimate calorie burn while exercising. Interestingly, this system is up to 25% more accurate than the Apple Watch. Working on such healthcare applications and building applications and machine learning models is generally hard due to the lack of participant data. We again leverage active learning to strategically recruit participants. We have found that by using our methods, we can significantly lower the effort required to recruit participants. Energy: Buildings across the world consume roughly one-third of the total energy expenditure. One way to reduce this energy is by providing occupants with feedback on their per-appliance energy usage. This has been shown to reduce energy expenditure by up to 15%. But, we can not install a sensor per appliance as it scales poorly in cost and maintenance effort. We proposed techniques to disaggregate the total energy consumption (measured at the household level using a smart meter) via machine learning into the energy consumption of constituent appliances. How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Being a faculty is a very rewarding experience. I have always maintained that the best way to learn is by teaching. Thus, this is one job that guarantees that one can keep improving and learning. This role gives us the opportunity to positively impact the lives of students (future leaders!). Being a faculty also allows us to pursue research directions that we find impactful and interesting. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the field of machine learning algorithms? Are there any particular conferences, journals, or online resources you find valuable and would suggest to the readers? The pace of innovation in our field and times is indeed hard to keep up to pace with. I spend dedicated time (~1-2 hours) daily morning studying some interesting machine learning talks/lectures (mostly YouTube) and then implementing them on my research blog. This helps me keep in touch with the theory and implementation aspects of these algorithms. Teaching courses and keeping the courses relevant and updated also helps me in this regard. Like other academics, I have also identified a subset of conferences in my field that I follow. To scale the learning, attending group seminars, faculty talks, and similar events is a must",

        discipline: "Discipline: Materials Science Engineering",
        info: "\n1)Please tell us a bit about yourself, your background, and your journey from IIT Gandhinagar to where you are now.\n\nAns : I am Rushik Desai, a Class of 2023 or BTech ‘19 student pursuing a Ph.D. in Materials Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. I would not say I always wanted to be a materials engineer, but I have loved physics and chemistry since my JEE days. Although, like every fish in the pond, since my first year, I wanted to get a job, bag a hefty salary, and live as a software engineer. Now, I wouldn’t say that while navigating through academics, I found my true passion lay in Materials Science since that would be a lie. My CPI from the first semester was 6.82, and dreams of a branch change out of the horizon. During my third semester, I got into materials science and atomistic simulations. (This might have been taken out of my SoP :p) Since then, I have been pursuing computational materials science. It might also be an excuse not to do something that requires physical effort, but I shall leave that to your interpretation. I chose to go for a Ph.D. degree because I always wanted to have enough free time to explore the vast world of materials science and also to delay the responsibilities that come with adulthood (this might be a joke!) Jokes apart, it has been quite a journey, and I am happy to say that I don’t regret pursuing computational materials science.\n\n2)How did your time at IIT Gandhinagar shape your values, skills, and overall outlook on life and career?\n\nAns : There are many factors and many people that enabled me to become who I am, and IIT Gandhinagar played a central role. From faculty to my peers and friends to my seniors, each of them has helped me in some way in advancing my academic and personal career. From the courses to my research projects, I have had the fortunate opportunity to interact with many faculty members, and my passion for their work has always inspired me. It might seem an understatement here, but I was glad I got one-to-one interactions with so many faculty members throughout my time. Apart from this, I have met the most creative bunch of people at IIT Gandhinagar, including my batchmates, seniors, and juniors, who have helped shape me in some way. Last but not least, having to work in organizing events has also been a massive part of who I am, and the student-centric nature of IIT Gandhinagar enabled me to do so. Well, who doesn’t love their alma mater? \n\n3)As the Marketing Core of Blithchron , and after holding several other PORs , could you share some of your most memorable experiences and achievements during your leadership roles?\n\nAns : Apart from all the shenanigans that comes with such a role, one of the best things that I still remember is sticking posters all over the place before the D-day. On no sleep, food, or rest, the way enthusiasm still flowed was very inspiring to see. All the brainstorming sessions, the treats that we gave to the juniors or received from the seniors, all the tense moments during the D-day or all those online meetings where everyone just kept their screen on and went away. I don’t think there was a single bad thing about the whole experience.\n\n4)Students often struggle with choosing the right career path. How did you approach this decision? Was it a process of trial and error, or did you always know you wanted to pursue a career in Computational Material Science?\n\nAns : More or less, it has always been trial and error for me. But I feel people tend to associate career with materialistic gain right from the beginning. This is not wrong but this makes them miss the chance to embrace the field they are working in. For example, I always wanted to do coding during my first year because I thought it fetches high paying jobs. Only when I started to code I realised this is not something I can do for a living. Although, right now a major part of what I do as research involved heavy bits of coding but I enjoy it. The reason is now I don’t see it as something that will bring me money but rather a part of my work that I have embraced and is helping me work on things I like. Also, there is no wrong career choice, being an IITian, we have the flexibility to explore a lot of avenues where one can become very successful. Especially coming from IIT Gandhinagar, I believe that owing to the small population of students, the opportunities become ten-fold and exposure that one gets is unparalleled. So no, I did not have a fixed career path in mind, I tried coding, computational materials science, experimental materials science, and then decided the right path for me.\n\n5)Moving from IIT Gandhinagar to Purdue University is a significant transition. How has your experience at IIT Gandhinagar contributed to your academic and personal growth, and how is it shaping your current pursuits at Purdue?\n\nAns : I wouldn’t think of it as a significant transition. Purdue is one of the most prestigious universities in the United States, if not the world. So is the status of an IIT in India. The professional etiquette instilled during my time at IIT-GN has helped me for a smooth transition. It sometimes does feel a lot similar to how we function at IIT-GN. But yes, having pursued research at IIT-GN has helped me get acquainted with a lot of skills that I still use. Furthermore, hostel life has made all of us enough independent to live and manage everything alone easily. It just feels like a next step on the ladder and not more of a transition.\n\n6)Looking ahead, what are your future goals and aspirations, both in terms of your academic journey and any other endeavors you are passionate about?\n\nAns : I wouldn’t term it as goals, but yes, I do wish to work in industry sometime in the future where I can apply all that I learn to some real-world applications. Although I do get swayed a lot by the idea of conducting self-motivated research, I believe that the education that I get should be put to use that can benefit a larger chunk of people (definitely took this from my SoP.) But one of my goals is to present at different conferences and meet people in academia. That, I believe is the biggest advantage of being a Ph.D. I get to meet people whose work I use in my day-to-day life. We shall see where the road takes us.\n\n7)For junior students who may be looking up to your journey, what advice would you offer them as they navigate their academic and extracurricular paths at IIT Gandhinagar, considering your experiences and the lessons you've learned?\n\nAns : Do what feels right and not forced. I always say this to anyone who asks what they can do for a particular situation. Be it a project or selecting a University or handling a PoR. The four years you get are way shorter than you think, so yes, you won’t be able to do everything you want. So do the things you want to do and give your 100% to them (took it off the web, but I won’t cite the source so that you think it is original.) I have taken projects and PoRs where I didn’t give my 100% and now I feel I wasted that time. I could’ve focussed on xyz instead. So make sure whatever you do, you feel right doing it. I took up the core position because I loved the role of a marketing core. And similar to the above question, I got pulled to computational materials science and thus I spent as many semesters I could working on it. One last thing, don’t ever feel there is no way out of a situation. Consult your friends, peers, seniors, staff or even faculty, I believe IIT-GN has fostered an atmosphere where help will always be given no matter for what. In short, do what you feel is right and can give your 100% to and stay hydrated!",

        name: "Ahana Ghosh",
        discipline: "Discipline: Researcher in Archaeology",
        info: "\n1)Please tell us a bit about yourself and your background. What sparked your initial interest in archaeology, and can you share some early experiences that fueled your passion for exploring the past?\n\nAns : As a researcher in archaeology, my life has been glutted with rewarding experiences that I have acquired in the last eight years since my Master's days. I have been fascinated by studying the past since my fourth standard in school. During those no-internet days, my class teacher created a conducive classroom environment for the young minds to nurture ideas like 'human evolution and civilization.' The academic atmosphere at home and the swift progress of my bachelor's in history, followed by my master's and MPhil in archaeology, provided me with a good knowledge of the past. They enhanced my interest in reconstructing the past through the present.\n\n2)There's a perception among some that the relevance of archaeological science is not as immediate or tangible in the contemporary world. How would you respond to this notion, and in what ways do you believe the study of archaeology, particularly focusing on ancient food processing and cultural landscapes, holds significance for us today?\n\nAns : Archaeology research takes an interdisciplinary approach worldwide; uncovering the past material culture requires a collaborative effort from different allied disciplines and cannot be done using an isolated approach. Many Universities in Europe and the USA have specialized departments for research on Archaeological Sciences, even providing degrees for the same. The biggest challenge faced by scholars in India is a specialized lab dedicated to archaeological samples, as samples should be protected from any kind of contamination while processing them, and certain controlled external conditions are also for the preservation of the samples. Besides, India is still growing in the above phenomenon, and am very proud to share that the Archaeological Sciences Centre, Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar, is the first and only Centre in the country solely dedicated to multifaceted archaeological sciences research. Additionally, the Centre has strong collaborations with different eminent  Institutes in India and abroad, creating student research opportunities.  I strongly believe that by following IITGN’s footsteps, more institutes would grow countrywide with the collaboration of different allied disciplines and eminent scientists.\n\nMy research, which is grounded on ancient food processing from Harappan culture and past culinary landscapes, implements scientific tools like organic residue analysis and compound-specific isotope analysis to delve into the ancient dietary patterns and subsistence strategies of the past communities.` As the field of ‘Food Archaeology’ is still in a rudimentary stage in South Asia, conventional ceramic studies must be reassessed and augmented with the latest scientific methodologies and with different nuances of ‘Food Anthropology’ to develop a broader view of ancient foodways at the site-specific and panoptic regional level for the subcontinent’s first complex society.\n\n3)How did you decide to pursue archaeological sciences at IIT Gandhinagar? Were there specific aspects of the program or faculty that influenced your choice ? Can you share some key moments or projects that stood out during this period and how they shaped your approach to archaeology?\n\nAns : After I returned to India from my Visiting Researcher position in Sweden, I was looking for a doctoral position at an institution specializing in Archaeological Sciences research. I was well aware of the immense scientific archaeological research ASC IITGN was conducting at that time. The moment I saw the Humanities and Social Sciences Department advertisement for Ph.D. positions, I decided to try my luck. Moreover, the extraordinary academic profiles of the ASC faculty aggravated my interest. As I am nearly coming to the end of my doctoral journey, I must say I have spent the best time of my academic journey in the last four years; this institute and its faculty fueled my scientific temperament and catered to me with opportunities. I am especially thankful to my doctoral supervisor, Prof. Sharada Channanrayapatna, for believing in me and constantly encouraging me to break the barriers. I am immensely grateful to Prof. V.N. Prabhakar, Prof. Michel Daninio, Prof. Sivapriya Kirubakaran, and Prof. Chinmay Ghoroi for their continued support and guidance.\n\nI believe being awarded the Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Research Scholarship was the best moment of my journey to date. After being rejected the first time, I was quite skeptical about applying for it again, but my doctoral supervisor, Prof. Sharada, advised me to work on my research problem more and to concentrate on academic growth till the second round of the application. The journey was never smooth; there were many undulated pathways till I ended up in the world-renowned Anthropology Department of the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n4)Moving into your master's level studies, how did you decide to specialize in ancient food processing, and what drew you to this specific aspect of archaeology?\n\nAns : I studied archaeology for my master's and MPhil, and my area of expertise focused on ancient ceramics and their composition and production process. Along with this interdisciplinary strive, I continued my archaeological explorations in coastal Bengal and the surrounding regions, which led to discovering several new sites. Working on the protohistoric ceramics from different excavated and explored archaeological sites in Eastern India matured my understanding of the varied facets of material cultural remains. Documenting ancient culinary practices, kitchen spaces, and collections of lost recipes and food memories is a domain that I am deeply passionate about. My job as a Junior Research Fellow in the Anthropological Survey of India and multiple projects in north India, especially in Himachal Pradesh and Ladakh, changed my understanding of culture and directed my interest in ethnographic studies. A streamline of fieldwork experiences in different corners of India and diverse gastronomic experiences, even in adverse conditions, has bestowed on me the idea of 'culinary landscape' and 'realities' and 'representation' around the concept of food. My aim is to narrate the voice of food from different parts of the subcontinent.\n\nMy internship days at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and IUAC, Delhi, under  Prof. Susanta Lahiri and Prof. Supriyo Das, Department of Geology, Presidency University, strengthened my skills in processing archaeological samples. Finally, during my visiting researcher days at Stockholm University, Sweden, I learned organic residue analysis under Prof. Sven Issakson and Prof. Kerstin Liden, creating the outline of my future doctoral research problem nestled around ancient food processing and vessel functions.\n\n5)In 2021, you took on the role of an Early Career Researcher at the Durham Antiquity Rewriting World Archaeology project. How did this opportunity come about, and what were some key experiences or projects you were involved in during this period?\n\nAns : Being an early career researcher at the Durham University ‘British Academy’, the ‘Global Challenge Research fund’ funded ‘Rewriting World Archaeology project’ is another opportunity that gave my career another academic direction. My project was among the top eight projects selected for mentorship and support. During this six-month-long intensive program, I worked on the ancient dietary patterns and subsistence strategies from the UNESCO World Heritage site of Dholavira, Gujarat, India. This program was extremely conducive to shaping my research, particularly on the methodological aspect. The valuable mentorship of Prof. Robin Coningham, Prof. Krishnan, Prof. Shanti Pappu, and Prof. Shahnaj Husne Janan provided a new direction to my doctoral research, particularly in my research writing and presentation skills.\n\n6)In 2020, you co-founded \"Quest,\" an online lecture platform. What inspired this initiative, and how did the platform evolve over time? How did guiding your team to conduct lectures impact your professional journey?\n\nAns : Quest gave me a new identity, an initiative that started as a collaborative endeavor among a few friends pursuing archaeology in different parts of the country during the pandemic to provide a platform for new researchers and increase awareness for archaeological research now in the process of growing a large organized online research platform.\n\nThrough our interactive sessions, my team and I aim to establish dialogues between the ongoing diversified developments in the broader discipline of human culture research to benefit the early career researcher community. For this purpose, we always try to initiate discussions over the recent developments in Archaeology, Anthropology, History, Cultural Studies, Heritage Studies, and Museology. We genuinely believe that this kind of initiative not only helps the researchers to generate new ideas in their respective fields but also, in the long run, can generate constructive awareness among the common masses by encouraging them to perceive and know more about their origin embedded in their heritage. Our logo demonstrates a monk carrying a trunk with a bird sitting on his head. This symbolizes that knowledge should be carried and shared equally among everyone, and irrespective of everything, it has the power to establish peace and harmony.\n\n7)Being an associate faculty member at the South Asia Centre, University of  Pennsylvania, is quite an achievement. How did this affiliation come about, and could you share some experiences or projects you've been involved in that highlight the collaborative efforts between your role at the South Asia Centre and your research interests?\n\nAns : Recently, during my Fulbright tenure at Penn, I got an opportunity to be associated with the prestigious South-Asia Centre of Penn. Being a researcher pursuing research in South-Asian archaeology, I became part of the Centre. Currently, I am working on the part of my doctoral project focused on the ancient food processing in Harappan Culture at Penn, but I am soon preparing myself to be part of more projects gleaned towards ancient food processing in South Asian Archaeology.\n\nAdditionally, I am also. a part of the Pyrotechnology Group in the Centre for Analysis of Archaeological Materials (CAAM) at the Penn Museum. The group is headed by Dr. Marie-Claude, Director of  CAAM, who executes different experimental archaeological work. My contribution to the group comprises of conducting cooking experiments in diverse climatic conditions.\n\n8)Working as a visiting researcher at Stockholm University, Sweden, and the University of North Carolina, Wilmington, must have provided unique perspectives. What were some key learnings or experiences from your time as a visiting researcher, and how did these international collaborations contribute to your overall research journey?\n\nAns : I worked as a Visiting Researcher at the University of Stockholm, Sweden, prior to joining my doctoral program and at the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. Besides developing my research skills, all these collaborations and working in different prestigious labs with diverse groups contributed to the great development of my professional and collaboration skills. During my role as Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Researcher, I have also been working with Prof. Eleanora A. Reber at the Department of Anthropology, the University of North Carolina, Wilmington. This collaboration has been on for the last two years. This year, along with working on my doctoral project samples, I am also giving lectures on Harappan Culture along with my doctoral work to the Undergraduate Students of the Department. Getting an opportunity to work under the precious guidance of Prof. Eleanora A. Reber in the ‘Ceramic Residue Analysis Laboratory of UNCW, a pioneer in the field of residue analysis research, after taking my initial training under Prof. Sven Isaksson, at ‘The Archaeological Research Laboratory, Stockholm University, Sweden. another legend in the field boosted my confidence to go ahead with my academic journey in the domain of food archaeological research.\n\n9)It's notable that you hold the student ambassador position at the Society for Archaeological Sciences, being the first South Asian to be given such a position in its long, prestigious journey. Can you share more about your responsibilities in this role and the impact you hope to make as a representative in a core American research society?\n\nAns : My journey with the Society for Archaeological Sciences (SAS) began with receiving the ‘Research Support Grant’’ back in 2022, which was followed by presenting my research at SciX 2022, Kentucky, USA, in the same year, funded by the Society for Archaeological Sciences and Society for Applied Spectroscopy and Chemistry. During the conference, I got a chance to share about archaeological sciences research in South Asia, the possibilities of collaborations, and the opportunities that can be provided to young scholars.\n\nIn early 2023, I was nominated as one of the Student Ambassadors of Society and was bestowed to engage young researchers in archaeological sciences research. Being the first South Asian to be given this position, I dedicated myself to the task of spreading awareness of the significance of Scientific tools in archaeological research and voicing about different issues faced by young scholars here, also increasing the South Asian membership of the organization.\n\n10)Becoming the first Fulbright scholar from Humanities and Social Sciences at IITGN and working as a Fulbright-Nehru Visiting Doctoral Researcher at the University of Pennsylvania is a significant milestone. Could you share the story of how this opportunity unfolded and its impact on your research and personal growth?\n\nAns : As I briefly shared about my journey of becoming a Fulbrighter in an Ivy League University like Pen, one of the above questions, here I will share a brief account of my journey.\n\nAt Penn, I am working under Professor Kathleen.D. Morrison, Department of Anthropology, who is one of the pioneers in the field. Getting nostalgic, I want to share that it's a dream come true for me. Prof.Morrison was an idol in this field since my Master’s days, whose work I have followed dedicatedly for the last eight years. At Penn, I have met and shared my research with all those archaeologists whose work I have been following dedicatedly for years.\n\nThe most important factor for becoming a Fulbrighter is creating an impactful research problem that is focused but has the possibility of highlighting diverse aspects. Remember, as a Fulbrighter, your knowledge should not be limited to your subject; as a cultural ambassador of your country, you should have awareness about different ongoing issues in your country and world, and your research should be a way to bridge the gap between different cultures and provide a harmonious exchange between the cultures irrespective of borders and divisions.\n\nThis journey impacted my academic growth a lot. Getting valuable guidance from Prof. Morrison and Prof. Mark Lycett has been conducive to shaping my thesis. The departmental library and the other academic resources available at the department and the Museum have been really helpful during this data interpretation and thesis writing phase.\n\nBesides academic activities, the Fulbright -Nehru Doctoral Research Scholarship provides opportunities to engage in multiple cultural activities. My Fulbright Pre-Academic days at the State University of Michigan with Fulbrighters from different parts of the world led to immense personal growth, giving me the best time of my life. Living under the same roof for months, we learned to respect each other's cultural values and differences, creating a sense of harmony and inspiring us to become world citizens.\n\n11)Looking ahead, what are your aspirations for your research in understanding the subsistence patterns of ancient Harappans, and how do you envision your work bringing a new dimension to our understanding of the past?\n\nAns : My research area elucidates the foodways of ancient Harappans from some of the selected settlements located in the Western and North-Western parts of India. I aim to explore their diet and ritual practices by examining the biomolecular components lying in the organic residues within ceramics used by the inhabitants of these settlements. I am also inclined to correlate the scientific data with the ethnographic parallels for better comprehension of the developmental trajectories in terms of continuities and changes in adaptive subsistence, exploitation of local and non-local resources, and vessel form and function in the Harappan society. Mortuary food is another crucial aspect of this research and aims to examine vessel residues as grave goods in the Harappan cultural topography.\n\nThe immediate outcome of this project will be to develop an idea about the ancient foodways of the Harappan settlements located in different geographic zones through understanding the commensality between the cultural use of the vessels and the kind of food processed inside them. Through my doctoral research, I aim to contribute to the studies of ‘ancient diet’ and ‘culinary landscape’, adding to the expanding corpus of research in the subcontinent.\n\n12)Reflecting on your own journey, what advice would you give to students aspiring to pursue a career in archaeology? Are there specific skills or mindsets that you believe are crucial for success in this field?\n\nAns : Looking back on my journey in the field for the last eight years, I want to suggest that the young scholars coming to the field be passionate, focused, and patient about their academic journey.\n\nThis field gives you the opportunity to come out of your comfort zone and explore different cultural patterns from past to present. Enjoying each phase of this journey, taking every essence of it in a never-give-up mode.\n\nI think being aware of the evolving techniques in the field and keeping an eye on the kind of work happening in parts of the world are conducive factors for growth in this field.",

        description: " Q. Can you please explain elaborately the research problems currently being addressed by you and your group? Looking from Lyman's perspective, how will your group's research effect a person's day to day life in the future? How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Whenever I think of the trajectory of cutting-edge Materials research, I am reminded of the famous motto of the Olympics, “Citius, Altius, Fortius” that encourages Olympians to aim for faster, higher and stronger performance. Materials development has been one of the best yardsticks of technological progress attested to by the naming of civilizational ages starting from the prehistoric stone age times, to bronze, iron, steel ages, and what we now call the silicon age. If one observes keenly, one can easily perceive that we have always tried to make our materials stronger, lighter, and simply, better in every conceivable way. Indeed, this pursuit has only progressed at breakneck speed in the 21st century, driven by a plethora of variables such as consumerism, defense and military applications, medical applications, etc., to name a few. In fact, the addition of a fourth word, “Communiter”, to the Olympics motto in 2021 that emphasizes togetherness is even more apt for Materials research - we want materials to have all the desirable properties together, or at the same time! At the Computational Molecular Engineering Group (CMEG) at IITGN, we work on advanced simulations of material structure, properties and design, with a view to understanding the complex relationships between them. These simulations make use of realistic descriptions of material interactions across various length and time scales, and when combined with appropriate input conditions and computational resources to run them on (mind you, simulating materials at the nanoscale (that is, a time scale of 1 nanosecond and a length scale of 1 nanometer may well take over several days!), yield an unprecedented level of detail that cannot be achieved through experimentation. This naturally accelerates the discovery, design and development of novel materials and is crucial for the success of programs such as the Materials Genome Initiative. I will highlight some of our ongoing projects briefly. The first is perhaps one of the oldest fields of Materials, alloy development. Here, we model novel, multi-component alloys (made up of several alloying additions) with a range of material defects and elucidate the role played by these defects on the mechanical properties of the alloy. We make use of state-of-the-art atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques to describe the interaction of the atoms and defects and to explain the mechanisms responsible for their observed properties. This has important implications for high-strength, high-toughness materials with applications in defense, aerospace and structural components. The second project looks into mechanisms of Lithium diffusion in modern Lithium ion batteries from the lens of computational materials science. To ensure optimum performance and safety of the battery, there has been an exciting push internationally to develop novel battery materials with superior properties and our group is pursuing some fundamental research in this direction. Thirdly, a focus of our group is to engineer materials that are inspired by nature, a field known as biomimetics. To give some perspective, natural materials such as spider silk, nacre (the inner lining of an oyster shell), bone, gecko’s feet, etc. have fascinating properties such as exceptional specific strength, toughness, adhesive properties and the like. We build atomistic models of these materials to understand the interplay between the structure and property that are helping us in predicting new design rules and eventually, development and deployment of these materials for various applications. Finally, being a Professor has been immensely beneficial to me personally in several respects and I am sure all faculty members share this sentiment. Working on cutting-edge research projects broadens one’s understanding of our world and gives us a lot of food for thought in this complex and intricate world that we live in. The joy of teaching is another very important aspect that cannot be put into words. Although it can definitely be daunting to keep pace with rapidly changing theories, ideas and methodologies, striking a good balance between research, teaching and other forms of service is a truly rewarding, but most importantly, a humbling experience.",

        description: "Kindly provide a comprehensive explanation of the research problems currently being addressed by you and your research group. Additionally, please elucidate how your group's research will impact individuals day-to-day lives in the future from a layman's perspective. Furthermore, could you share examples of successful real-world applications where the machine learning algorithms you have developed or researched have been implemented, leveraging your expertise in Machine Learning? Our group called the sustainability group, works on applications pertaining to energy, air quality and health. We mostly work on machine learning problems with uncertainty. Here is a flavour of the kind of work we do. Air quality: A significant proportion of the Indian (and global) population is exposed to severe air pollution leading to several diseases and loss of life. We can not reduce what we can not accurately measure. However, the number of air quality measurement stations is significantly lower than the required numbers. Our work develops Bayesian machine learning methods to accurately estimate air quality at locations without any sensors. Importantly, we focus on not only providing the predicted air quality at a location but also uncertainty estimates. We then leverage this uncertainty to recommend where to install the next set of stations (also called active learning) to improve the predictive performance of our models. Health: The Apple Watch and similar wearables such as portable diabetes machines and oxygen saturation monitors have revolutionised healthcare. We look at creating similar wearables for estimating lung function and calorie count. We developed a mask-based system called SpiroMask that can accurately estimate various lung health parameters using an inexpensive system sitting at home, which earlier required a visit to a clinic. Similarly, we are presently developing a thermal camera-based system to accurately estimate calorie burn while exercising. Interestingly, this system is up to 25% more accurate than the Apple Watch. Working on such healthcare applications and building applications and machine learning models is generally hard due to the lack of participant data. We again leverage active learning to strategically recruit participants. We have found that by using our methods, we can significantly lower the effort required to recruit participants. Energy: Buildings across the world consume roughly one-third of the total energy expenditure. One way to reduce this energy is by providing occupants with feedback on their per-appliance energy usage. This has been shown to reduce energy expenditure by up to 15%. But, we can not install a sensor per appliance as it scales poorly in cost and maintenance effort. We proposed techniques to disaggregate the total energy consumption (measured at the household level using a smart meter) via machine learning into the energy consumption of constituent appliances. How do you think being a professor is beneficial to you while also being involved in rapidly progressing research work? Being a faculty is a very rewarding experience. I have always maintained that the best way to learn is by teaching. Thus, this is one job that guarantees that one can keep improving and learning. This role gives us the opportunity to positively impact the lives of students (future leaders!). Being a faculty also allows us to pursue research directions that we find impactful and interesting. How do you stay up-to-date with the latest advancements and trends in the field of machine learning algorithms? Are there any particular conferences, journals, or online resources you find valuable and would suggest to the readers? The pace of innovation in our field and times is indeed hard to keep up to pace with. I spend dedicated time (~1-2 hours) daily morning studying some interesting machine learning talks/lectures (mostly YouTube) and then implementing them on my research blog. This helps me keep in touch with the theory and implementation aspects of these algorithms. Teaching courses and keeping the courses relevant and updated also helps me in this regard. Like other academics, I have also identified a subset of conferences in my field that I follow. To scale the learning, attending group seminars, faculty talks, and similar events is a must",

        description: "Q. It has been often seen that undergraduate students at our institute get confused when they first hear what Biological Engineering is. The contribution made by the branch and the people working often goes unnoticed due to a lack of awareness. However, in recent times, the branch has received center stage due to the pandemic. Since you have had great experience working in biological engineering, can you elaborate on the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the manner in which students from other engineering disciplines can contribute to the field? This would help unravel the ‘cool' side of the field and help them realize what the branch actually is. Whenever you talk to an engineering student about a department of biology or life sciences, the first thing or picture that comes in their minds is the foul-smelling mouse or rats or bacteria, or some microscopes or machines, or proteins or DNA doing something with the biomolecules which no engineering student want to talk about. Especially engineering students or tech students try to avoid learning biology in schools or intermediate colleges or their interests are not aroused in their courses. And to the great surprise, at IITGN, the first course that is taught to the first year BTech students is BE101: Introduction to Life Sciences. The first question that we ask the students is “How many of you hate biology?” and almost all the students raise their hands. However, by the end of their end of BTech, many students land up taking more courses in biological sciences as well as doing minors or projects with faculties in biological engineering discipline… One of the biggest reasons of success of biological engineering department in institutes like IITs, particularly IITGN is we focus more on “Engineering the Biological Systems”. We ask multiple research questions in biology which actually involve our understanding fundamental laws of physics, chemistry and engineering. Our courses and projects involve a huge fraction of engineering and our research areas span the full spectrum of cutting-edge research domains like Genetics, Neuroscience, Computational Biology, Bionanotechnology, Structural Biology, Chemical engineering, Biomedical devices and engineering. And our motto is “We teach what we do”. All these cutting-edge areas including some tinges from allied areas are like machine learning, bioinformatics, advanced microscopy and applied biological engineering and biomedical engineering are included in a very balanced manner in the syllabus of all the courses offered by biological engineering discipline. These are in perfect sync with the fundamental scientific principles of biology where students learn right from the scratch asking simple but at the most complex questions like – what is life, is there life on other planets, what are we made up of, how biological information is saved in DNA, is DNA a computer, what are biomacromolecules, how do they work, what are cells, tissues, organs and systems in body, what are diseases and pathogens, how do they spread, what are the cures, so on and so forth. There is a perfect blend of scientific knowledge and engineering which arouses a lot of curiosity among the engineering students leading to their appreciation of life sciences at the end of their courses. In today’s times when diseases and other health hazards are right on the doorsteps, it is important that engineering students take keen interests in biological sciences and engineering and we are sure have such courses in institutes like IITs will churn out the best biomedical engineering like Robert Langer for the times to come. Some of the great challenges lying ahead where engineers will greatly contribute are genetic engineering, better healthcare, personalized medicine, climate change, agriculture and animal husbandry, robotics, biomedical devices, etc etc. To know more about our discipline and research activities, please do visit our website and labs at https://www.bio.iitgn.ac.in.",
