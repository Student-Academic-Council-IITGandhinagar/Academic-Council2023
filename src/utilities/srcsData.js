The course will begin with an overview of how the web works and the technologies involved. Students will get hands-on experience building a website; they will start with simply creating the skeleton of websites using HTML and exploring fundamental HTML tags. The course will then move towards beautifying the structure using CSS, and then we will teach about adding functionality to the website using JavaScript. The course will also cover the deployment of websites, and students will be taught how to use Netlify and GitHub to deploy their projects. This course is Part I of an upcoming long series on web development. Part II will cover the ReactJS library (frontend). Part III will cover backend web development.",

Familiarize themselves with the tools, languages, and practices that every web developer needs to know. \n3. Develop interactive web pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. \n4. Learn about responsive web design and accessibility in web development. \n5. Pave the way to learn advanced web development frameworks and libraries such as Reactjs, Nodejs and more.",

Probability is employed in modeling and predicting real-world phenomena, contributing to various machine learning algorithms and the learning processes in neural networks. Calculus, particularly in the context of optimization, is used to understand how machine learning models learn and improve over time by minimizing errors, a process central to the training of deep learning models."
            + " \n The course will equip participants with a foundational understanding of mathematics in the context of AI, allowing them to navigate the field of AI with an informed perspective. This course aims to be the first of a series of courses where we will slowly transition from mathematics, to coding up fundamental building blocks as well as advanced architectures that have cutting-edge, real-world applications.",

The idea is that by thinking about mathematical problems, students are prodded into learning MATLAB for the purpose of solving the problem at hand. The down-side to this approach is that it is somewhat based on the idea that people are already excited about mathematics, or can be excited about it.",

Hence they try to refrain from it. But this causes their money to sit into a position of non-performance. Investing in markets has risks but it comes with rewards too. According to Warren Buffet, the risk comes from not knowing our own actions."

As an engineer in future years to come many students would create fortune but making fortune is not a difficult task but growing it is. If not managed and grown properly, the value of money erodes over time and it's time value decreases.
